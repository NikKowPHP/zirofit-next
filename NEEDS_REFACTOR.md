# Refactoring Required: Invalid Package Version

## Problem
The package.json contains an invalid version string for `@supabase/ssr`:
```json
"@supabase/ssr": "^极狐0.6.1"
```
This version string contains non-standard characters and will break dependency installation.

## Resolution Steps
1. Revert the version to the correct format in package.json:
```json
"@supabase/ssr": "^0.6.1"
```
2. Run `npm install` to verify the dependency can be installed correctly

## Verification
1. Run `npm install` and confirm it completes without errors
2. Run `npm test -- --watchAll=false` to ensure all tests pass

## Status
✅ Resolved - Package version corrected and verified
