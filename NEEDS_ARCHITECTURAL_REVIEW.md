# Architectural Review Required: Proxy Configuration Conflict

## Original Error
Module not found: Can't resolve 'net' in agent-base/dist/index.js
Import trace through https-proxy-agent -> supabase/client.ts -> NotificationIndicator.tsx

## Failed Fix Attempts
N/A (First escalation)

## System Impact Analysis
1. Proxy configuration conflicts with browser environment
2. Incompatible Node.js modules in client-side code
3. Multiple proxy configurations exist (docker-compose.proxy*.yml)
4. https-proxy-agent dependency is unnecessary for browser usage
