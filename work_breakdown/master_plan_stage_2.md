# **ZIRO.FIT: Master Implementation Plan (v2 - UX & Production Readiness)**

This document outlines the high-level, phased plan for enhancing the **ZIRO.FIT** **SaaS Marketplace and Platform** with a mobile-first UI, Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities, and production-grade testing and observability. The successful completion of all phases will result in a more robust, user-friendly, and reliable application.

## The Plan

### `[ ]` Phase A: PWA & Observability Foundation

**Goal:** Configure the application to function as an installable Progressive Web App (PWA) and integrate Sentry for production error monitoring. This phase establishes the foundational tooling for a more resilient application.

### `[x]` Phase B: Test Suite Implementation & Core Logic Coverage

**Goal:** Establish a comprehensive testing environment and write unit and integration tests for the application's most critical business logic, focusing on server actions related to user profiles, clients, and bookings to ensure backend stability and prevent regressions.

### `[ ]` Phase C: Mobile UI/UX Overhaul

**Goal:** Refactor the primary application layouts and components to be mobile-first. This includes implementing a new bottom navigation bar for the trainer dashboard on mobile devices and ensuring all pages are fully responsive and user-friendly on smaller screens.
