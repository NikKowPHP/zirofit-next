# **ZIRO.FIT: Master Implementation Plan (v2.1 - REVISED)**

This document outlines the revised, high-level plan for enhancing the **ZIRO.FIT** platform. This revision accounts for the features implemented in Stage 1 and provides a more accurate roadmap for adding a mobile-first UI, Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities, and comprehensive test coverage.

## The Plan

### `[ ]` Phase A: PWA & Observability Foundation

**Goal:** Configure the application to function as an installable Progressive Web App (PWA) and integrate Sentry for production error monitoring. This phase establishes the foundational tooling for a more resilient application.

### `[ ]` Phase B: Comprehensive Test Suite Implementation

**Goal:** Expand the test suite to provide comprehensive coverage for all critical business logic implemented in Stage 1, including booking validation, search filtering, and dashboard data services, to prevent regressions and ensure backend stability.

### `[ ]` Phase C: Mobile UI/UX Overhaul

**Goal:** Refactor the primary application layouts and components to be mobile-first, implementing a new bottom navigation bar for the trainer dashboard, and ensuring all dashboard widgets, including charts and stats, are fully responsive and user-friendly on smaller screens.
