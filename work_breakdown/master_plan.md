# **ZIRO.FIT: Master Implementation Plan (v1)**

This document outlines the high-level, phased plan for building the **ZIRO.FIT** **SaaS Marketplace and Platform**. It serves as the single source of truth for the development roadmap, guiding the team through each stage of implementation for the new public-facing search and booking features. The successful completion of all phases will result in a fully functional, production-ready marketplace.

## The Plan

### `[x]` Phase A: Database & Backend Foundation for Booking

**Goal:** Establish the core data structures and backend logic required to support scheduling and availability. This involves extending the database schema and creating the internal tools for trainers to manage their calendars.
