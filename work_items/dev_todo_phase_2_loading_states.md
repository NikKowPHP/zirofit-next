# Loading States Implementation Plan

## Objective
Add skeleton loading states to all dashboard components during data fetching

## Tasks
1. Create skeleton components for:
   - [ ] Profile checklist section
   - [ ] Quick actions panel
   - [ ] Activity feed
   - [ ] Client spotlight

2. Integrate with SWR:
   - [ ] Use isLoading flag from useSWR hooks
   - [ ] Add error state handling

3. Style requirements:
   - [ ] Match existing color scheme
   - [ ] Implement subtle pulse animations
   - [ ] Ensure proper spacing/margins

4. Testing:
   - [ ] Verify loading states appear during slow network (use Chrome DevTools)
   - [ ] Check mobile responsiveness
   - [ ] Ensure no layout shift between states

## Implementation Notes
- Reuse existing Skeleton component from src/components/ui/Skeleton.tsx
- Each skeleton should approximate the final component's dimensions
- Consider adding 200ms delay to prevent flickering on fast networks
