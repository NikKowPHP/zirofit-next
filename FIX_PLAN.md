# FIX_PLAN: Resolve Missing Refactoring Instructions

## Problem
The `NEEDS_REFACTOR.md` file was present in VSCode open tabs but not found on disk, preventing the Developer AI from proceeding with refactoring tasks.

## Resolution Steps
1. Recreated `NEEDS_REFACTOR.md` with placeholder content
2. Updated project manifest to document recovery action
3. Created this FIX_PLAN.md to document the resolution
4. Set FIX_PLAN.md as active plan in manifest
5. Deleted NEEDS_ASSISTANCE.md signal file

## Implementation Details
- Created placeholder NEEDS_REFACTOR.md with instructions to check work items
- Added "system_recovery" entry to architectural_map in manifest
- Set active_plan_file to FIX_PLAN.md in manifest
- This file serves as the resolution record
