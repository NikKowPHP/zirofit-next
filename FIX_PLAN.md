# Notification System Database Fix Plan

## Root Cause Analysis
The `public.Notification` table is missing from the database despite being defined in the Prisma schema. This indicates either:
1. The migration containing the Notification model was never run
2. The migration was incomplete
3. The database is out of sync with the schema

## Fix Implementation Steps

- [x] **Task 1: Create new migration for Notification model**
  - **LLM Prompt:** "Run `npx prisma migrate dev --name add_notification_model` to create and apply a new migration"
  - **Verification:** New migration file appears in `prisma/migrations/` folder

- [x] **Task 2: Verify database schema**
  - **LLM Prompt:** "Run `npx prisma studio` and visually confirm Notification table exists"
  - **Verification:** Notification table appears in Prisma Studio with correct columns

- [x] **Task 3: Regenerate Prisma client**
  - **LLM Prompt:** "Run `npx prisma generate` to regenerate client"
  - **Verification:** No errors in console output

- [x] **Task 4: Test notifications endpoint**
  - **LLM Prompt:** "Make GET request to `/api/notifications`"
  - **Verification:** Returns empty array (or existing notifications) without errors

- [ ] **Task 5: Clean up and reset for autonomous handoff**
  - **LLM Prompt:** "Delete the file `NEEDS_ARCHITECTURAL_REVIEW.md` from the root directory."
  - **Verification:** The file `NEEDS_ARCHITECTURAL_REVIEW.md` no longer exists
