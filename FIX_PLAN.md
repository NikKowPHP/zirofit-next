# Comprehensive Fix Plan for Prisma Client Initialization

## Problem Analysis
The build fails with "@prisma/client did not initialize yet" error despite multiple attempts to generate and update the client. This indicates a systemic issue with Prisma integration in the Next.js project.

## Fix Tasks

### Task 1: Verify Prisma Client Generation in Build Script
- **LLM Prompt**: "Update the build script in package.json to run 'prisma generate' before 'next build'."
- **Verification**: The package.json build script includes 'prisma generate' before 'next build'.
- **Status**: [x] Complete

### Task 2: Check Prisma Client Imports
- **Status**: [x] Complete
- **LLM Prompt**: "Search all files for '@prisma/client' imports and ensure they follow best practices (e.g., not in client-side code)."
- **Verification**: All imports are correctly placed and follow Prisma's usage guidelines.

- **Status**: [x] Complete
### Task 3: Validate Prisma Schema and Environment
- **LLM Prompt**: "Check prisma/schema.prisma for errors and ensure DATABASE_URL is properly set in .env."
- **Verification**: The schema is valid and environment variables are correctly configured.

### Task 4: Clear Next.js Cache
- **LLM Prompt**: "Run 'rm -rf .next' to clear Next.js cache before rebuilding."
- **Verification**: The .next directory is removed before build.

### Task 5: Rebuild and Test
- **LLM Prompt**: "Run 'npm run build' to verify the fix."
- **Verification**: Build completes without Prisma client errors.

### Task 6: Clean up and reset for autonomous handoff
- **LLM Prompt**: "Delete the file NEEDS_ARCHITECTURAL_REVIEW.md from the root directory."
- **Verification**: The file NEEDS_ARCHITECTURAL_REVIEW.md no longer exists.
