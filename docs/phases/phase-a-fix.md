Excellent work on the internationalization effort. A significant amount of progress has been made, and the core infrastructure using `next-intl` has been implemented correctly. The routing, middleware, and server-side setup are solid foundations.

Let's break down the implementation against the plan.

### What Was Implemented Correctly (The Wins)

You have successfully completed a large portion of the plan, especially the foundational and most complex parts:

*   **Core Infrastructure:** The `next-intl` setup, including `i18n.ts`, the new `[locale]` directory structure, and the `NextIntlClientProvider` in the root layout, are all correctly in place.
*   **Routing and Middleware:** The `middleware.ts` file correctly combines i18n routing with Supabase authentication, which is a critical and tricky piece of the puzzle. It properly handles redirects while preserving the locale.
*   **Public Pages:** The main public-facing pages (`/`, `/trainers`, `/trainer/[username]`) and their shared layouts (`PublicLayout`) have been successfully translated.
*   **Backend Logic:** You've correctly refactored server actions (`auth/actions.ts`) to use `messageKey` for translatable success/error messages, and `useServerActionToast` to consume them. The email templates are also correctly internationalized.
*   **Zod Validation:** You've successfully implemented i18n for Zod server-side validation messages, which is an advanced and important step.

### What Is Missing or Incomplete

While the foundation is strong, the translation effort needs to be extended to cover the entire authenticated user experience. The primary gaps are within the trainer's dashboard.

**1. Untranslated Dashboard Components (Major Gap)**

*   **Issue:** A significant number of components within the authenticated dashboard (`/clients`, `/profile/edit`) still have hardcoded English strings. The translation work stopped after the main layouts and public pages.
*   **Examples:**
    *   `src/components/clients/ClientDetailView.tsx`: Tab names like "Statistics", "Measurements", "Progress Photos" are hardcoded.
    *   `src/components/clients/modules/*.tsx`: All of these components (`ManageClientMeasurements`, `ManageClientSessionLogs`, etc.) contain untranslated titles, labels, placeholders, and button text (e.g., "Manage Measurements", "Add New Measurement", "Weight (kg)").
    *   `src/components/profile/sections/*.tsx`: The profile editor sections (`BrandingEditor`, `CoreInfoEditor`, `ServicesEditor`, etc.) have hardcoded titles, labels, and button text.

**2. Date & Time Formatting**

*   **Issue:** Some components still use generic date formatting methods like `toLocaleDateString()` without passing the current locale.
*   **Example:** In `src/app/[locale]/dashboard/_components/ActivityFeed.tsx`, the line `new Date(activity.date).toLocaleDateString()` will use the server's or browser's default locale, not the one from the URL (`en` or `pl`). This can lead to inconsistent date formats.
*   **Fix:** Use `useFormatter` from `next-intl` or pass the locale to `toLocaleDateString({locale})` to ensure consistent formatting.

**3. Language Switcher Component**

*   **Issue:** The plan included creating a language switcher component to allow users to manually toggle between `en` and `pl`. This component has not been created or added to the layouts.
*   **Impact:** This is a key feature for both usability and for easily testing the internationalization work.

### Minor Refinement

*   **Login Page Logic:** In `src/app/[locale]/auth/login/page.client.tsx`, the component checks for `state?.message`. However, the server action `loginUser` no longer returns a `message`, but redirects with a `messageKey` in the URL params. This part of the code is now redundant, though harmless. The check for `searchParams.get("messageKey")` is correct and handles the flow.

### Conclusion and Updated To-Do List

You have successfully completed about **60%** of the internationalization plan. The most difficult structural work is done. The remaining work is primarily a matter of applying the established translation pattern across the rest of the application's components.

Here is the updated, focused to-do list to complete the implementation:

### **Next Steps: Completing UI Internationalization**

**Phase 1: Translate All Remaining Dashboard Components**

*   [ ] **Task 1.1: Translate Client Management UI:**
    *   Go through every file in `src/components/clients/` and `src/components/clients/modules/`.
    *   Use the `useTranslations` hook to replace all hardcoded strings (titles, labels, buttons, empty states, etc.) with keys from `en.json` and `pl.json`.

*   [ ] **Task 1.2: Translate Profile Editor UI:**
    *   Go through every file in `src/components/profile/sections/`.
    *   Use `useTranslations` to translate all titles, labels, buttons, placeholders, and helper text.
    *   Update `ProfileEditorSidebar` to translate the section names.

**Phase 2: Finalization & Polish**

*   [ ] **Task 2.1: Implement Consistent Date Formatting:**
    *   Search the project for any instances of `.toLocaleDateString()`, `.toLocaleTimeString()`, and `format()` from `date-fns`.
    *   Ensure they are all passed the current `locale` to guarantee correct formatting for both English and Polish users.

*   [ ] **Task 2.2: Create and Add Language Switcher:**
    *   Create a new component (`LanguageSwitcher.tsx`).
    *   Use the `useRouter` and `usePathname` from `next-intl/client` to build links that switch the locale.
    *   Add this component to a visible part of the `PublicLayout` and `TrainerDashboardLayout` headers.

**Phase 3: Final QA**

*   [ ] **Task 3.1: Full Application Review:**
    *   Navigate through every single page and component in both `/en` and `/pl`.
    *   Verify that no English text remains on Polish pages (except for user-generated content).
    *   Test all forms, server actions, and toast notifications to ensure messages are translated.
    *   Send a test booking confirmation email and verify it is translated correctly.

By completing these remaining tasks, the application's UI will be fully internationalized as planned.
