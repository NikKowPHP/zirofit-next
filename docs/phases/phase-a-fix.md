You've encountered a TypeScript error, and it's a good catch. The error message `Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'role' does not exist in type 'ClientSelect<DefaultArgs>'` is very specific.

### Root Cause

The error is happening because I tried to select the `role` field from a `Client` record in `src/app/[locale]/trainer/[username]/page.tsx`:

```typescript
// The problematic code:
const clientRecord = await prisma.client.findUnique({
  where: { userId: sessionUser.id },
  select: { role: true, trainerId: true } // <-- ERROR HERE
});
```

The TypeScript error is correct: the `Client` model in your `prisma/schema.prisma` file does not have a `role` field. The `role` field exists on the `User` model. The `Client` model has a `userId`, which links to the `User`, but the `role` itself is not duplicated on the `Client` table.

### The Fix

To fix this, we need to tell Prisma to follow the relation from `Client` to `User` and select the `role` from the related `User` record.

Here is the corrected and fully updated `src/app/[locale]/trainer/[username]/page.tsx` file.

### Updated File: `src/app/[locale]/trainer/[username]/page.tsx`

I've changed the Prisma query to correctly fetch the role via the user relation.

```typescript
```

This updated query is now type-safe and correctly fetches the necessary data to determine if the visiting user is a client and if they are already linked to the trainer. The error should now be resolved.
