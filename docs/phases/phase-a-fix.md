The test failures indicate two separate issues:

1.  **Redirect Path Mismatches:** The authentication action tests (`auth.actions.test.ts`) are failing because the expected redirect URLs do not match the actual URLs. This is due to the recent introduction of i18n routing, which prefixes all paths with the current locale (e.g., `/en`) and uses message keys for notifications instead of hardcoded strings. The tests need to be updated to expect these new, correct paths.
2.  **i18n Configuration Error in Jest:** The middleware test suite (`middleware.test.ts`) fails to run because it imports `src/i18n.ts`, which calls `getRequestConfig` from `next-intl/server`. The Jest mock for this library is incomplete and does not provide a mock for `getRequestConfig`, causing a `TypeError`.

The solution is to:
1.  Update the redirect assertions in `src/app/[locale]/auth/actions.test.ts` to match the i18n-aware paths.
2.  Enhance the mock for `next-intl/server` in `jest.setup.ts` to include a dummy implementation for `getRequestConfig`, resolving the `TypeError`.

Here are the file modifications to fix the test suite.
