An analysis of the provided code and issue description reveals several TypeScript errors and warnings that need to be addressed. The primary error is a module resolution issue with `next-intl`. Other issues include incorrect typings for JSON fields, unused variable warnings, and mismatches between function definitions and their usage.

Here is a summary of the fixes that will be implemented:

1.  **`next-intl` Module Resolution:** The import path `next-intl/client` in `src/components/layouts/LanguageSwitcher.tsx` is incorrect for the installed version of `next-intl`. This will be corrected to `next-intl/navigation`, which is the correct path for client-side navigation hooks in `next-intl@3.9.0+`.

2.  **JSON Field Typing:** In `src/components/clients/modules/ManageClientExerciseLogs.tsx`, the `log.sets` property, which comes from a JSONB database column, is incorrectly typed as `unknown` by TypeScript in a `.map()` operation. I will add an explicit type assertion `(log.sets as any[])` to ensure it's treated as an array, resolving the runtime error and associated type errors.

3.  **Unused `prevState` Parameters:** Numerous server actions use the `useFormState` hook, which provides a `prevState` argument. In many cases, this argument is unused, leading to TypeScript warnings. I will prefix all unused `prevState` parameters with an underscore (e.g., `_prevState`) to signify that they are intentionally unused, thus cleaning up the warnings.

4.  **`useEditableListManager` Hook Type:** The `DeleteAction` type within the `useEditableListManager` hook is missing the `messageKey` property in its return promise. This causes type errors in components that use this hook and expect a `messageKey` for displaying internationalized toast messages. The type definition will be updated to include `messageKey?: string`.

5.  **Miscellaneous Code Cleanup:**
    *   Unused imports, such as `Cog6ToothIcon` in `ProfileEditorSidebar.tsx` and `act` in `NotificationIndicator.test.tsx`, will be removed.
    *   Unused function parameters, like `event` in `NotificationIndicator.test.tsx`, will be removed or prefixed with an underscore.
    *   Redundant JSDoc comments will be removed from files like `notificationService.ts` where TypeScript types already provide the necessary information.

These changes will resolve the reported TypeScript errors, eliminate warnings, and improve the overall quality and maintainability of the codebase.
