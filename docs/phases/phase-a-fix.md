This is an excellent step towards creating a robust and reliable testing environment. Using Docker for E2E tests ensures a clean, consistent database for every test run, eliminating flakiness caused by leftover data.

Here is my plan to implement this:

1.  **Add a new task to the test plan**: I will add a new "Phase 0" to the `E2E_TESTS.md` file to document the setup of the Dockerized testing environment and mark it as complete.
2.  **Install `dotenv-cli`**: This package is needed to load the new `.env.test` file when running scripts from `package.json`. I will add it to the `devDependencies`.
3.  **Create `docker-compose.yml`**: This file will define the PostgreSQL service that will be used exclusively for our E2E tests. It will be configured to run on a different port (`5433`) to avoid conflicts with any local development database.
4.  **Create `.env.test`**: This new environment file will contain the `DATABASE_URL` pointing to the Dockerized PostgreSQL instance, along with other necessary environment variables for the application to run in a test context.
5.  **Update `package.json`**: I will add a new script, `dev:test`, to run the Next.js development server using the `.env.test` configuration. I will also update the main `test:e2e` script to orchestrate the entire process: starting the Docker container, running database migrations, executing the Playwright tests, and finally, shutting down the container.
6.  **Update `playwright.config.ts`**: I will modify the `webServer` configuration to use the new `npm run dev:test` script, ensuring that Playwright starts the application connected to the correct test database.

This implementation will fully automate the setup and teardown of the E2E test environment.

# âœ… Playwright E2E Test Implementation Plan

This document outlines the atomic tasks required to implement a comprehensive End-to-End (E2E) testing suite for the ZIRO.FIT application using Playwright. The goal is to ensure all core user flows are tested, bugs are caught before deployment, and new features don't break existing functionality.

## Phase 0: Test Environment Setup

- [x] **Configure Docker for E2E Testing:**
    - [x] Create a `docker-compose.yml` file to define a PostgreSQL service for testing.
    - [x] Create a `.env.test` file with a `DATABASE_URL` pointing to the Docker container.
    - [x] Add `dotenv-cli` package to run scripts with the test environment.
    - [x] Create an `npm run dev:test` script to start the Next.js server with the test database.
    - [x] Update `playwright.config.ts` to use the `npm run dev:test` command for its `webServer`.
    - [x] Update the `npm run test:e2e` script to manage the Docker container lifecycle (up, migrate, test, down).

## Phase 1: Setup & Foundational Tests

This phase focuses on improving the test environment and expanding the most critical user flow: authentication.

-   [x] **Configure Global Authentication State:**
    -   [x] Create a global setup file in Playwright (`global.setup.ts`).
    -   [x] In the setup file, programmatically log in as a test trainer (`ada@ziro.fit`) and a new test client.
    -   [x] Save the authentication state (cookies, local storage) to files (e.g., `trainerAuth.json`, `clientAuth.json`).
    -   [x] Update `playwright.config.ts` to use this global setup. This will allow tests to start in a logged-in state, making them faster and more reliable.

-   [x] **Create a New Test File: `authentication.spec.ts`**
    -   [x] Move the existing registration test from `auth.spec.ts` into this new file.
    -   [x] **Test Case: Trainer Login Success**
        -   [x] Navigate to the `/auth/login` page.
        -   [x] Fill in valid trainer credentials.
        -   [x] Click the "Log In" button.
        -   [x] Assert that the page redirects to `/dashboard`.
        -   [x] Assert that a "Dashboard" heading is visible.
    -   [x] **Test Case: Trainer Login Failure**
        -   [x] Navigate to the `/auth/login` page.
        -   [x] Fill in an invalid password.
        -   [x] Click the "Log In" button.
        -   [x] Assert that an error message (e.g., "Invalid credentials") is displayed.
        -   [x] Assert that the URL is still `/auth/login`.
    -   [x] **Test Case: Client Registration & Login**
        -   [x] Create a test for a new user registering with the "Client" role.
        -   [x] Assert the user is redirected to the login page with a success message.
        -   [x] Log in as the new client.
        -   [x] Assert the user is redirected to the `/client-dashboard`.
    -   [x] **Test Case: Logout Flow**
        -   [x] Start the test in a logged-in state (using the global setup).
        -   [x] Navigate to the `/dashboard`.
        -   [x] Click the "Log Out" button.
        -   [x] Assert the user is redirected to the `/auth/login` page with a "Logged out successfully" message.

## Phase 2: Trainer Dashboard - Comprehensive Profile Management

    -   [x] Assert the new exercise log appears in the history below the form.
    -   [x] Navigate to the "My Progress" tab and verify the chart data is present.

-   [x] **Test Case: Client Links to a Trainer**
    -   [x] Start authenticated as a client who is *not* linked to a trainer.
    -   [x] Navigate to a test trainer's public profile page (`/trainer/ada-lovelace`).
    -   [x] Assert the "Share My Data with..." button is visible.
    -   [x] Click the "Share My Data" button and confirm in the modal.

    -   [x] Run the entire test suite against the mobile viewport to catch responsive design issues.
    -   [x] Add a specific test case in `dashboard.spec.ts` to verify the bottom navigation bar is visible on mobile and that clicking its links works correctly.
-   [x] **Code Cleanup:**
    -   [x] Refactor all test files to use the global authentication state where applicable.
    -   [x] Create helper functions for common actions (e.g., `login(page, role)`, `createClient(page, clientDetails)`).
    -   [x] Review all tests for clarity, remove redundant steps, and ensure robust selectors (`data-testid`) are used everywhere.
